OVERVIEW 
The market data feed is a stream of FAST encoded FIX messages which provides the 
following real-time information for each instrument traded on The Chittagong Stock 
Exchange1: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
(iv) 
(v) 
(vi) 
Price depth information for the order book. The feed provides information on the 
aggregated displayed quantity and the number of displayed orders for each of the top 
<five> price points. <Delete if the feed is configured for order depth> 
Order depth information for the order book. The feed provides information on the 
price and displayed quantity of each order in the top <five> price points. <Delete if the 
feed is configured for price depth> 
Details (e.g. price, volume, time, etc.) of on and off-book trades. 
Indicative auction price and the associated trade volume and imbalance. 
Statistics (e.g. high/low, volume, VWAP, etc.). 
Trading status. 
Each instrument is traded on a series of separate and independent sub books (e.g. regular, 
odd lot, etc.). The above information is disseminated per instrument and sub book 
combination. An update transmitted on the feed includes an indication of the instrument and 
sub book to which it relates. 
In addition, the feed includes market and sector statistics as well as the value of each index 
computed by The Chittagong Stock Exchange. It also provides participants with the active 
instrument list of and disseminates market announcements. 
The feed is a multicast service based on the technology and industry standards UDP, IPv4, 
FAST and FIX. The application messages are defined using the FIX 5.0 (Service Pack 2) 
standard and comply with the best practices outlined by the FIX Market Data Working 
Group. Please refer to Section 6.1 for the instances where the server varies from the FIX 
protocol. The data feed is transmitted in the FAST encoding method to minimize bandwidth 
and reduce latency and conforms to Level 1 of the FAST 1.1 specification. 
Hours of Operation 
The feed will operate from <Start Time> to <End Time> each trading day. 
Support

SERVICE DESCRIPTION 
System Architecture  
The market data feed is load 
balanced by market data group. 
While each group will contain 
multiple 
instruments, 
each 
instrument is assigned to just one 
market data group. Although the 
group an instrument is assigned to 
may change from day to day, it will 
not change within a day. Market 
data for all sub books (e.g. regular, 
odd lot, etc.) for a particular 
instrument are transmitted from the 
same market data group. 
Each market data group includes a 
multicast Real-Time channel for the 
dissemination of market data. 
Two TCP recovery channels are 
available per market data group; 
Snapshot and Replay.  
While a recipient may connect to the 
Replay channel to recover from a 
small data loss, it should use the 
Snapshot channel after a large data 
loss (i.e. late joiner or major outage). 
Real-Time Channel 
The Real-Time Channel is the 
primary means of disseminating 
market data. Real-time updates to 
instruments and all market data 
supported by the feed are available 
on this multicast channel.

 Market Data Group (Backup Site)
 The list of active instruments in the market data group is broadcast at the start of the trading 
day via the Security Definition message. The details of instruments created during trading 
hours will also be disseminated in via this message. Real-time updates of the trading status 
of instruments will be disseminated via the Security Status message. 
Real-time updates to order books, indicative auction information and statistics are published 
along with the details of each trade via the Market Data Incremental Refresh message. 
While each Market Data Incremental Refresh includes a channel specific message 
sequence number in the field ApplSeqNum (1181), each market data entry in the message 
includes an instrument specific sequence number in the field RptSeq (83). The channel and 
instrument level sequence numbers are to reset to 1 at the start of each day. 
The server will use the Heartbeat message to exercise the communication line during 
periods of inactivity. A Heartbeat will be sent every <2> seconds when the Real-Time 
channel is inactive. 
Recipients have access to two identically sequenced Real-Time feeds; one from the main 
site (Feed A) and one from the backup site (Feed B). It is recommended that recipients 
process both feeds and arbitrate between them to minimise the probability of a data loss.

3.1.3 
Snapshot Channel 
The TCP Snapshot channel permits recipients to request a snapshot of the order book and 
statistics for any active instrument in the market data group as well as its current trading 
status. In addition, it enables recipients to request the retransmission of the trades published 
during the last <10> minutes on the Real-Time channel. It also enables recipients to 
download the list of active instruments in the market data group. This channel may be used 
by recipients to recover from a large-scale data loss. 
All messages sent by the server are transfer encoded in terms of the FAST protocol. While 
all application messages sent by the server (e.g. Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh)) are 
field encoded, the administrative messages it sends (e.g. Logon, Heartbeat, etc.) are not. All 
messages (i.e. both administrative and application) initiated by the client should be transfer 
encoded but not field encoded. 
While a Snapshot channel is available from the backup site, it will only be activated in the 
unlikely event of an outage at the main site. 
Replay Channel 
The TCP Replay channel permits recipients to request the retransmission of a limited 
number of messages already published on the Real-Time channel. This channel may be 
used by recipients to recover from a small data loss. 
The Replay channel supports the retransmission of the last <10,000> messages published 
on the Real-Time channel. The channel does not support the retransmission of messages 
published on the Snapshot channel or from previous trading days. 
All messages sent by the server are transfer encoded in terms of the FAST protocol. While 
all application messages sent by the server (e.g. Market Data Incremental Refresh, Security 
Definition, etc.) are field encoded, the administrative messages it sends (e.g. Logon, 
Heartbeat, etc.) are not. All messages (i.e. both administrative and application) initiated by 
the client should be transfer encoded but not field encoded. 
While a Replay channel is available from the backup site, it will only be activated in the 
unlikely event of an outage at the main site.

The regular day for on-book trading will consist of four scheduled sessions: Pre-Open, 
Opening, Regular Trading and Post-Close. The start time for each of these sessions may

At the start of the reporting period a Security Status message, with a SecurityTradingStatus 
(326) of Regular Trading (17) and an MDSubBookType (1173) of Off-Book (2), will be 
broadcast for each instrument for which trade reporting is permitted. Similarly, a Security 
Status message, with a SecurityTradingStatus (326) of End of Trading Reporting (130) and

3.3.4 
3.3.5 
3.3.6 
Trading Halt 
A Security Status message, with a SecurityTradingStatus (326) of Halt (2), will be published 
if an instrument is halted during the day. The reason for the halt and whether it applies to a 
particular sub book (e.g. regular, odd lot, etc.) or to trade reporting will be specified in the 
HaltReason (327) and MDSubBookType (1173) fields respectively. If trading is later 
resumed a Security Status message, with the appropriate status (e.g. Regular Trading (17)) 
and MDSubBookType (1173), will be published. A trading halt will not be carried forward to 
the next trading day. 
Pause 
A Security Status message, with a SecurityTradingStatus (326) of Pause (111), will be 
published if on-book trading for an instrument is paused during the day. A Security Status 
message, with the appropriate status (e.g. re-opening auction call) will be published if 
trading is later resumed. A pause will not be carried forward to the next trading day. 
Instrument Suspension 
An instrument may be suspended during or outside trading hours. The suspension may be 
lifted later in the day or it may be carried forward to subsequent trading days. A Security 
Definition message, with a SecurityStatus (965) of Suspended (9), will be published if an 
instrument is suspended during trading hours. A suspension applies to both on-book trading 
and trade reporting. 
If, at the start of a trading day, an instrument is still in a suspended state it will be included in 
the Security Definition messages published by the server but not the Security Status 
messages. A Security Definition message, with a SecurityStatus (965) of Active (1), will be 
published if the suspension is lifted during trading hours. Separate Security Status 
messages will also be published if on-book trading and/or trade reporting is enabled for the

3.3.6.1 Extension of an Auction Call 
An auction call may be extended due to a market order imbalance or if the current auction 
price is significantly different from the last sale. In such a case, a Security Status message 
will be broadcast with the value Market Order Extension (1) or Price Monitoring Extension 
(100) in the field SecurityTradingEvent (1174). This message will also include the new time 
at which the auction will take place in the Text (58) field. 
3.3.6.2 Adjustment by Market Operations 
The Chittagong Stock Exchange may extend or shorten a particular trading session. In such 
a case, a Security Status message will be broadcast with the value Extended by Market 
Operations (101) or Shortened by Market Operations (102) in the field SecurityTradingEvent 
(1174). The message will indicate whether the change applies to a particular sub book (e.g. 
regular, odd lot, etc.) or to trade reporting. The new time at which the session will end will be 
specified in the Text (58) field. 
3.3.7 
New Instruments 
New instruments may be created during the trading day. In such a case, the server will 
publish a Security Definition message to notify recipients of the details of the new instrument 
(symbol, segment, underlying, expiration date, etc.). Separate Security Status messages will 
also be published if on-book trading and/or trade reporting is enabled for the instrument.

3.4.1 
Order Book Management (Price Depth)2 
The market data feed provides recipients with a view of the regular and odd lot order books, 
where all orders are aggregated at each price level, for <five> price levels. The feed 
provides the aggregate displayed quantity and the number of represented orders at each 
price level. 
Incremental Refresh 
A Market Data Incremental Refresh message will be published to update an order book. A 
message may contain multiple market data entries each of which could add, change or 
delete one side of one price level. Each entry includes the fields MDSubBookType (1173) 
and MDPriceLevel (1023) to indicate the sub book and price level being updated. A single 
message may include entries for multiple instruments and sub books. 
3.4.1.1 Adding a Price Level 
When a new price level is created in an order book a Market Data Incremental Refresh 
message will be broadcast with an MDUpdateAction (279) of New (0). The message will 
include the price, aggregate displayed quantity and number of orders for the price level. 
The field MDPriceLevel (1023) will indicate the display position of the price level being 
added. Price levels are numbered from most to least competitive and start with â1â. All rows 
in the order book below the new price level should be pushed down. The recipientâs 
application should automatically re-number the price levels below the newly added price 
level. If there were already <five> price levels, recipients should also delete the new <sixth> 
price level from their applications. 
If MDPriceLevel (1023) is set to â1â the message will update the top of the order book. The 
recipientâs application should ensure that there are no prices higher than this price level. 
3.4.1.2 Changing a Price Level 
When an existing price level is changed a Market Data Incremental Refresh message will be 
broadcast with an MDUpdateAction (279) of Change (1). The field MDPriceLevel (1023) will 
indicate which price level is being updated. The message will include the price, quantity and 
number of orders for the updated price level. 
3.4.1.3 Deleting a Price Level 
When an existing price level is removed a Market Data Incremental Refresh message will 
be broadcast with an MDUpdateAction (279) of Delete (2). The field MDPriceLevel (1023) 
will indicate which price level is being removed. 
All rows in the order book below the deleted price level should be pushed up. The recipientâs 
application should automatically re-number the price levels that were below the deleted 
price level. The server will separately publish an update to add a new price level at the 
bottom of the order book. 
3.4.2 
Snapshot 
Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) messages will be used to disseminate the full picture 
of each order book. The snapshot will include the price, aggregate display quantity, number 
of orders and display position for each price level. 
A snapshot will be published even if there are no orders in the order book. In such a case, 
the Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) message will include an MDEntryType (269) of 
Empty Order Book (J). 
An order book snapshot may span across multiple Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) 
messages. In such cases, the LastFragment (893) field will be âNâ for all but the final 
message for the instrument. The final message will include a LastFragment (893) of âYâ

While the vast majority of snapshot messages are disseminated via the Snapshot channel, 
in certain scenarios (e.g. recovery after a server failure), they may also be included in the 
Real-Time channel. Snapshots on the Real-Time channel should be processed by 
recipients.

3.5.1 
Market Orders3 
The aggregate displayed quantity of market orders, if any, on each side of the order book, 
along with the number of represented orders, is disseminated during each Pre-Auction 
session. 
In the case of market orders, the relevant market data entry of a Market Data Incremental 
Refresh or Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) message will include an MDEntryType 
(269) of Market Bid (b) or Market Offer (c). Such entries will not include an MDPriceLevel 
(1023) or an MDEntryPx (270). 
Order Book Management (Order Depth)4 
The market data feed provides recipients with a view of each order in first <five> price points 
of the order book. The feed provides the price and displayed quantity of each order. 
Incremental Refresh 
A Market Data Incremental Refresh message will be published to update an order book. A 
message may contain multiple market data entries each of which could add, change or 
delete an order. A single message may include entries for multiple instruments and sub 
books. 
Each entry includes an indication of the sub book and an identifier of the order in the fields 
MDSubBookType (1173) and MDEntryID (278) respectively. As the order identifier is the 
OrderID (37) assigned to it by the matching system, recipients will be able to identify their 
own orders while ensuring anonymity. Order IDs, and therefore MDEntryIDs, are unique 
across all instruments and across trading days. 
3.5.1.1 Adding an Order 
When a new order is added to the order book a Market Data Incremental Refresh message 
will be broadcast with an MDUpdateAction (279) of New (0). The message will include the 
price and displayed quantity of the order. 
While the field MDPriceLevel (1023) will indicate the display position of the price level the 
order is added to, the field MDEntryPositionNo (290) will indicate its position within the price 
level. Price levels are numbered from most to least competitive and start with â1â. Similarly, 
position numbers within a price level are numbered from most to least competitive and start 
with â1â for each price level. 
If the order is added at a new price level, all rows in the order book below the new price 
level should be pushed down. The recipientâs application should automatically re-number 
the price levels below the newly added price level. If there were already <five> price levels, 
recipients should also delete the new <sixth> price level from their applications. 
If, in terms of its MDEntryPositionNo (290), an order is added ahead of some existing orders 
at the price level, these orders should be pushed down. The recipientâs application should 
automatically re-number the position numbers of orders at the price level if they are below 
the newly added order. 
If MDPriceLevel (1023) is set to â1â the message will update the top of the order book. The 
recipientâs application should ensure that there are no prices higher than this price level. 
Similarly, if MDEntryPositionNo (290) is set to â1â the message will update the top of the 
price level. The recipientâs application should ensure that there are no orders higher than 
this order at the price level.

3.5.1.2 Updating an Order 
A Market Data Incremental Refresh will be broadcast with an MDUpdateAction (279) of 
Change (1) if an existing order is updated without a loss of priority (e.g. a reduction in order 
quantity). The field MDEntryID (278) will indicate which order is being updated. The 
message will include the orderâs price and updated display quantity. The relevant 
MDPriceLevel (1023) and MDEntryPositionNo (290) will also be provided. 
If the update of an existing order results in a loss of priority (e.g. an increase in order 
quantity, a change in price, etc.), the update will be communicated via two actions; a delete 
(as outlined below) followed by an addition. 
3.5.1.3 Deleting an Order 
If an existing order is removed a Market Data Incremental Refresh will be broadcast with an 
MDUpdateAction (279) of Delete (2). The field MDEntryID (278) will identify the order being 
removed. 
Orders at the price level of the deleted order should be pushed up if they were below it. The 
recipientâs application should automatically re-number the position numbers of such orders. 
If the order was the only order at the price level, all rows in the order book below the deleted 
price level should be pushed up. The recipientâs application should automatically re-number 
the price levels that were below the deleted price level. The server will separately publish 
updates to add orders at the new price level at the bottom of the order book. 
3.5.2 
3.5.3 
3.5.4 
Snapshot 
Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) messages will be used to disseminate the full picture 
of each order book. The snapshot will include the price and displayed quantity of each order 
along with the display position of each price level and order. 
A snapshot will be published even if there are no orders in the order book. In such a case, 
the Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) message will include an MDEntryType (269) of 
Empty Order Book (J). 
An order book snapshot may span across multiple Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) 
messages. In such cases, the LastFragment (893) field will be âNâ for all but the final 
message for the instrument. The final message will include a LastFragment (893) of âYâ 
While the vast majority of snapshot messages are disseminated via the Snapshot channel, 
in certain scenarios (e.g. recovery after a server failure), they may also be included in the 
Real-Time channel. Snapshots on the Real-Time channel should be processed by 
recipients. 
Market Orders5 
The displayed quantity of each market order is disseminated during each Pre-Auction 
session. 
In the case of market orders, the relevant market data entry of a Market Data Incremental 
Refresh or Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) message will include an MDEntryType 
(269) of Market Bid (b) or Market Offer (c). Such entries will not include an MDPriceLevel 
(1023) or an MDEntryPx (270). The MDEntryPositionNo (290) of the entry will indicate the 
display position of a market order in relation to other market orders. 
Attributed Orders6 
The entry of a Market Data Incremental Refresh or Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) 
message used to disseminate the details of an attributed order will include the identity of the 
submitting firm in the field PartyID (448).

Time and Sales 
The market data feed provides recipients with the price, volume, time and sub book (e.g. 
regular, odd lot, etc.) for each executed trade. Details of trade cancellations and corrections 
will also be broadcast. 
When a trade is executed a Market Data Incremental Refresh message will be broadcast 
with an MDUpdateAction (279) of New (0) and MDEntryType (269) of Trade (2). The trade 
price, quantity, time and sub book will be specified in the fields MDEntryPx (270), 
MDEntrySize (271), MDEntryTime (273) and MDSubBookType (1173) respectively. 
Each trade will include a unique Trade ID in the field MDEntryID (278) which will be 
referenced if the trade is cancelled or corrected. As this identifier is the TradeID (1003) 
assigned to the trade by the post trade system, recipients will be able to identify their own 
trades. Trade IDs are unique across all instruments and across trading days. 
Auction Trades 
The Market Data Incremental Refresh message will contain a MatchType (574) of Auction 
(5) and a TradeCondition (277) of Opening Price (R) if the trade was executed in an opening 
auction. 
Pre-Negotiated Trades 
In the case of a pre-negotiated trade, the Market Data Incremental Refresh message will 
include an MDSubBookType (1173) of Off-Book (2). The trade type will be indicated in the 
TrdSubType (829) field. The message will also include the date and time the trade was 
executed on the systems of the counterparties in the fields MDEntryDate (272) and 
MDEntryTime (273) respectively. 
Trade Cancellation and Corrections 
If a trade is cancelled a Market Data Incremental Refresh message will be broadcast with an 
MDUpdateAction (279) of Delete (2) and an MDEntryType (269) of Trade (2). The message 
will contain the Trade ID of the cancelled trade in the field MDEntryID (278). 
If a trade is corrected a Market Data Incremental Refresh message will be broadcast with an 
MDUpdateAction (279) of Change (1) and an MDEntryType (269) of Trade (2). The 
message will contain the Trade ID of the corrected trade, the corrected price and the 
corrected quantity in the fields MDEntryID (278), MDEntryPx (270) and MDEntrySize (271) 
respectively. 
A trade cancellation is final (i.e. once a trade is cancelled it will not be reinstated). A 
corrected trade may subsequently be corrected again or cancelled. 
Indicative Auction Information 
The market data feed provides recipients with the indicative auction price as well as the 
executable volume, imbalance quantity and the side of the imbalance at this price. This 
information will be updated every <twenty> seconds until <two> minutes prior to the auction 
at which point it will be updated every <five> seconds. The update frequency is configurable 
and may be changed with due notice to recipients. 
During a Pre-Auction session a Market Data Incremental Refresh message will be 
broadcast with two market data entries. The first entry will be the indicative auction price 
and the executable quantity at this price. The second entry will be the imbalance quantity 
and side at the indicative price. 
The first entry will contain an MDUpdateAction (279) of New (0), an MDEntryType (269) of 
Auction Clearing Price (Q) and an MDQuoteType (1070) of Indicative (0). The indicative 
auction price and the executable quantity will be specified in the fields MDEntryPx (270) and 
MDEntrySize (271) respectively. The entry will not include an MDEntryPx (270) and

MDEntrySize (271) if an indicative auction price does not exist (i.e. the order book is not 
locked or crossed). 
The second entry will contain an MDUpdateAction (279) of New (0) and an MDEntryType 
(269) of Imbalance (A). The imbalance quantity and side at the indicative price will be 
specified in the fields MDEntrySize (271) and TradeCondition (277) respectively. The entry 
will include an MDEntrySize (271) of zero and will not contain a TradeCondition (277) if 
there is no imbalance.

Mode of Dissemination 
3.8.3.1 Incremental Update 
Incremental updates of statistics will be disseminated via the Market Data Incremental 
Refresh message. The MDEntryType (269) and MDSubBookType (1173) of each entry in 
such a message will indicate the statistic that is being updated and the sub book to which it 
applies. The MDUpdate Action (279) of all entries will be New (0). 
In the event a statistic (e.g. closing price) needs to be corrected, a Market Data Incremental 
Refresh message will be transmitted with the corrected value. The entry will not include an 
MDEntryPx (270) or MDEntrySize (271) in the unlikely event a previously published statistic 
is withdrawn (e.g. closing price). 
3.8.3.2 Snapshot 
Snapshots of statistics will be disseminated via the Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) 
message. The MDEntryType (269) and MDSubBookType (1173) of each entry in such a 
message will indicate the statistic that is being updated and the sub book to which it applies. 
A snapshot will be published even if there are no statistics for an instrument. In such a case, 
the Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) message will include an MDEntryType (269) of No 
Statistics (z). 
While the vast majority of snapshot messages are disseminated via the Snapshot channel, 
in certain scenarios (e.g. recovery after a server failure), they may also be included in the 
Real-Time channel. Snapshots on the Real-Time channel should be processed by 
recipients. 
3.9 
Indices 
The market data feed provides recipients with the value of each index which is updated <<in 
real-time> or <every ten seconds>>. 
When the value of an index is updated a Market Data Incremental Refresh message will be 
broadcast with an MDUpdateAction (279) of New (0) and an MDEntryType (269) of Index 
Value (3). The unique identifier and updated value of the index will be specified in the fields 
Symbol (55) and MDEntryPx (270) respectively. 
The value of each index will be updated to reflect the closing price of each constituent 
instrument once these prices are published. Each such index update will include a 
TradeCondition (277) of Closing Index (AJ). 
The closing value of each index from the previous trading day will be published a 
configurable period after the market opens. Each such update will include a TradeCondition 
(277) of Previous Closing Index (ZZ).

The values specified in the MDEntryPx (270) field of the Market Data Snapshot (Full 
Refresh) and Market Data Incremental Refresh messages should, depending on the 
quotation convention for the instrument, be interpreted as price per share for equity 
instruments.  
The quotation convention for each instrument will be disseminated via the PriceType (423) 
field of the Security Definition message. 
Announcements 
Market announcements are included in the market data feed. In addition to the actual text of 
the announcement and an associated headline or subject, recipients are provided with its 
urgency, the time it was generated and the list of instruments, if any, to which it relates. 
Announcements are disseminated via the News message.

The CompID of each client wishing to connect to the Snapshot and Replay channels must 
be registered with The Chittagong Stock Exchange before communications can begin. A 
CompID may, at any particular time, only be logged into one Snapshot channel and one 
Replay channel across all market data groups. 
4.2.2.1 Passwords 
Each new CompID will be assigned a password on registration. Clients are strongly 
encouraged to change the password to one of their choosing via the Logon message. The 
acceptance of a login request indicates that the new password has been accepted. The new 
password will, if accepted, be effective for subsequent logins. 
In terms of the password policy of The Chittagong Stock Exchange, the password of each 
CompID should be changed at least every <30> days. If not, the password will expire and 
the client will be unable to login to the server. In such a case, the client should contact The 
Chittagong Stock Exchange to have its password reset. The SessionStatus (1409) of the 
serverâs Logon message will be Password Due to Expire (2) for the last <5> days of a 
passwordâs validity period.

4.3 Production IP Addresses and Ports 
The market data feed is load balanced by market data group. While each group will contain 
multiple instruments, each instrument is assigned to just one market data group. Although 
the group an instrument is assigned to may change from day to day, it will not change within 
a day. The Security Definition messages available on the Real-Time channel of the various 
market data groups may be utilized by recipients to identify the instruments assigned to 
each group. 
The production IP addresses and ports of the Real-Time, Snapshot and Replay channels for 
each market data group are given below.

RECOVERY 
Recipient Failures 
It is recommended that recipients process both Real-Time feeds (i.e. Feed A and Feed B) to 
minimise the probability of a data loss. 
A message loss can be detected using the ApplSeqNum (1181) included in each message 
on the Real-Time channel. If a gap in sequence numbers is detected, the recipient should 
assume that some or all of the order books and statistics maintained on its systems are 
incorrect and initiate one of the recovery processes outlined below. 
Each entry of a Market Data Incremental Refresh message disseminated on the Real-Time 
channel also includes an instrument specific sequence number in the field RptSeq (83). 
Recipients may use this instrument level sequencing to determine the instruments for which 
a recovery process should be initiated. 
Snapshot Channel 
The TCP Snapshot channel should be used by recipients to recover from a large-scale data 
loss (i.e. late joiner or major outage). 
The channel permits recipients to request a snapshot of the order books and book-level 
statistics for the active instruments in the market data group. In addition, it enables 
recipients to request the retransmission of trades published during the last <10> minutes on 
the Real-Time channel. It also enables recipients to download the list of active instruments 
in the market data group. Snapshots of index values, market statistics and sector statistics 
are not available. 
Each CompID may login to the Snapshot channel of a particular market data group up to 
<5> times each day. The total number of Security Definition Request and Market Data 
Request messages that a client may submit on the Snapshot channel of a particular market 
data group is also limited to <100> each day. Recipients may request The Chittagong Stock 
Exchange to reset its login and request counts. This feature is intended to help manage an 
emergency situation and should not be relied upon as a normal practice. 
If a client submits multiple requests on the Snapshot channel, they will be processed serially 
(i.e. one at a time). Active requests of multiple clients will be served on a round robin basis. 
A client may not have more than <10> concurrent unprocessed requests at any point. 
All messages sent by the server are transfer encoded in terms of the FAST protocol. While 
all application messages sent by the server (e.g. Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh), 
Security Definition, etc.) are field encoded, the administrative messages it sends (e.g. 
Logon, Heartbeat, etc.) are not. All messages (i.e. both administrative and application) 
initiated by the client should be transfer encoded but not field encoded. 
5.1.1.1 Establishing a Connection 
The client should use the relevant IP address and port (as outlined in Section 4.3) to 
establish a TCP/IP session with the Snapshot channel. The client should initiate a 
connection by sending the Logon message. The client should identify itself by specifying its 
CompID in the Username (553) field. 
The server will validate the CompID, password and IP address  of the client. Once the client 
is authenticated, the server will respond with a Logon message. The SessionStatus (1409) 
of this message will be Session Active (0). 
The client must wait for the serverâs Logon before sending additional messages. Messages 
received from the client before the exchange of Logon messages will be ignored. 
If a logon attempt fails because of an invalid CompID, password or IP address, the server 
will break the TCP/IP connection with the client without sending a Logout message. If a 
logon attempt fails because of an expired password, a locked CompID or if logins are not

 Page 22 / 61 
currently permitted, the server will send a Logout and then break the TCP/IP connection 
with the client. 
The Snapshot channel supports only <100> concurrent logins across all clients. In addition, 
each CompID may login to the Snapshot channel of a particular market data group up to 
<5> times each day. If either of these limits is reached, the server will reject a new logon 
attempt with a Logout and then break the TCP/IP connection with the client. The 
SessionStatus (1409) of such a Logout message will be Logons Not Allowed (7). 
If a Logon is not received within <5>7 seconds of the establishment of a TCP/IP connection 
or a Security Definition Request or Market Data Request is not received within <5>
 <5
 >
 seconds of a successful logon, the server will send a Logout message and then break the 
TCP/IP connection with the client.  
5.1.1.2 Heartbeats 
The server will not send heartbeats on the Snapshot channel during periods of inactivity. 
5.1.1.3 Requesting Instruments 
Once connected to the Snapshot channel, clients may use the Security Definition Request 
message to request the details of all active instruments in the market data group or those in 
the group from a particular segment. The Security Definition Request should include a 
unique SecurityReqID (320) and a SecurityRequestType (321) (i.e. all instruments or all 
instruments for a segment). 
If the request is successful, the server will disseminate the details of each instrument via the 
Security Definition message. Each such message will include a SecurityResponseType 
(323) of List of Securities Returned (4) and the SecurityReqID (320) of the request. The last 
message sent in response to the request will include a LastRptRequested (912) of Last 
Message (Y). The client will not receive the details of any subsequent master file updates. 
An invalid Security Definition Request will generally be rejected via a Security Definition 
message with a SecurityResponseType (323) of Cannot Match Selection Criteria (6). 
However, a Business Message Reject will be used if a conditionally required field is missing 
or a request limit (for the day or for outstanding requests) breached. 
5.1.1.4 Requesting Snapshots: Order Book and Statistics 
Once connected to the Snapshot channel, clients may use the Market Data Request 
message to request a snapshot of the current order books or statistics for one or more 
instruments in the market data group. Clients may also request snapshots for the 
instruments in the market data group that are assigned to one or more segments. The 
Market Data Request should include an MDReqID (262) and at least one Symbol (55) or 
ProductComplex (1227). 
A request for an order book snapshot should include an MDEntryType (269) of Bid (0) 
and/or Offer (1). An order book snapshot will always contain the details both sides the order 
book even if the Market Data Request contained just an MDEntryType (269) of Bid (0) or 
Offer (1). Clients are unable to request just one side (i.e. bid or offer) of an order book. 
Similarly, a request for a statistics snapshot should include one or more of the relevant 
entries for MDEntryType (269) (e.g. High Price (7), Low Price (8), Volume (B), etc.). A 
statistics snapshot will contain all available statistics even if the Market Data Request 
contained just some of the statistics-related entries for MDEntryType (269). Clients are 
unable to request for a snapshot of selected statistics (e.g. high price and low price only). 
The MDSubBookType (1173) field of the Market Data Request may be used if the client 
wishes to recover the order book or statistics for a specific sub book (e.g. regular, odd lot, 
etc.). If an MDSubBookType (1173) is not included in a request, the server will interpret it as 
a request for all of the sub books that apply to the instrument.

A client may request both an order book snapshot and a statistics snapshot in a single 
Market Data Request. A single message may also be used to request snapshots for multiple 
instruments and/or multiple segments. 
If the Market Data Request is successful, the server will disseminate a snapshot of the 
current order book or statistics for each sub book via a Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) 
message. Each such message will include the MDReqID (262) of the applicable Market 
Data Request. The order book and statistics snapshot for a particular sub book of an 
instrument will be disseminated via two separate Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) 
messages. 
Each Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) will reflect the order book or statistics for the sub 
book of an instrument as per the last update on the Real-Time channel. The ApplSeqNum 
(1181) and RptSeq (83) of the applicable Market Data Incremental Refresh from the Real
Time channel will be included in the LastMsgSeqNumProcessed (369) and RptSeq (83) 
fields of each Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) respectively. 
An order book or statistics snapshot will be published even if there are no orders or statistics 
for a sub book of an instrument. In such a case, the Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) 
message will include an MDEntryType (269) of Empty Order Book (J) or No Statistics (z). 
Each Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) message will include the current trading status 
(e.g. regular trading) of the sub book in the field MDSecurityTradingStatus (1682). 
The last message sent in response to the request will include a LastRptRequested (912) of 
Last Message (Y). The client will not receive any subsequent order book or statistics 
updates for the applicable instruments. 
An invalid Market Data Request will generally be rejected via a Market Data Request Reject 
message. However a Business Message Reject will be used if a conditionally required field 
is missing or a request limit (for the day or for outstanding requests) breached. 
5.1.1.5 Requesting Missed Trades 
Once connected to the Snapshot channel, clients may use the Market Data Request 
message to request missed trades for one or more instruments in the market data group. 
Clients may also request missed trades for the instruments in the market data group that are 
assigned to one or more segments. The Market Data Request should include an MDReqID 
(262) and at least one Symbol (55) or ProductComplex (1227). 
Clients are unable to request for trades relating to a specific sub book (e.g. regular, odd lot, 
etc.). A request for missed trades will result in the re-transmission of trades for all sub books 
that apply to the instrument. 
A Market Data Request for missed trades should include an MDEntryType (269) of Trade 
(2). The request should also include the sending time of the last trade on the Real-Time 
channel processed by the client in the MDEntryTime (273) field. 
A client may request missed trades and order book and/or statistics snapshots in a single 
Market Data Request. A single message may also be used to request missed trades for 
multiple instruments and/or multiple segments. 
If the Market Data Request is successful, the server will retransmit all the trades for the 
specified instruments and/or segments after the specified time. Each missed trade will be 
published via a Market Data Incremental Refresh message. Each such message will include 
the MDReqID (262) of the applicable Market Data Request. The corresponding message 
and instrument sequence numbers from the Real-Time channel will be included in the 
ApplSeqNum (1181) and RptSeq (83) fields of each retransmitted trade. The last message 
sent in response to the request will include a LastRptRequested (912) of Last Message (Y). 
If the request includes an MDEntryTime (273) that is prior to that of the oldest trade in the 
serverâs cache, all eligible trades in the cache will be retransmitted. Clients are unable to 
recover trades not in the serverâs cache. 
An invalid Market Data Request will generally be rejected via a Market Data Request Reject 
message. If no trades have been missed, the Market Data Request Reject will include an 
Chittagong Stock Exchange - Market Data Feed (FAST - UDP) v1.07
 _v1.0

 Page 24 / 61 
MDReqRejReason (281) of âZâ and the value â102â (i.e. requested market data unavailable) 
in the Text (58) field. 
A Market Data Request will be rejected via a Business Message Reject if a conditionally 
required field is missing or a request limit is breached. 
5.1.1.6 Cancelling a Request 
A client may cancel an outstanding instrument or market data request via the Security 
Definition Request or Market Data Request respectively. Such a message should include a 
SubscriptionRequestType (263) of Unsubscribe (2) and the SecurityReqID (320) or 
MDReqID (262) of the request to be cancelled. While the server will not confirm a 
successful cancellation, it will transmit a Business Message Reject if the request is rejected. 
5.1.1.7 Termination of the Connection 
If the client does not send a Logout and terminate the connection within <5>
 seconds of 
the transmission of the last application message, the server will send a Logout message 
and then break the TCP/IP connection with the client. 
<5
 >
 The server will terminate the TCP/IP connection (a Logout will not be sent) if the number of 
messages that are buffered for a client exceeds <1,000>. 
5.1.2 
Replay Channel 
The TCP Replay channel should be used by recipients to recover from a small-scale data 
loss. It permits recipients to request the retransmission of a limited number of messages 
already published on the Real-Time channel. The channel supports the retransmission of 
the last <10,000> messages published on the Real-Time channel. 
Each CompID may login to the Replay channel of a particular market data group up to <10> 
times each day. The total number of Application Message Requests that a client may send 
on the Replay channel of a particular market data group is also limited to <10> each day. 
Recipients may request The Chittagong Stock Exchange to reset its login and request 
counts. This feature is intended to help manage an emergency situation and should not be 
relied upon as a normal practice. 
If a client submits multiple requests on the Replay channel, they will be processed serially 
(i.e. one at a time). Active requests of multiple clients will be served on a round robin basis. 
A client may not have more than <1> concurrent unprocessed requests at any point. 
All messages sent by the server are transfer encoded in terms of the FAST protocol. While 
all application messages sent by the server (e.g. Market Data Incremental Refresh, Security 
Definition, etc.) are field encoded, the administrative messages it sends (e.g. Logon, 
Heartbeat, etc.) are not. All messages (i.e. both administrative and application) initiated by 
the client should be transfer encoded but not field encoded. 
5.1.2.1 Establishing a Connection 
The client should use the relevant IP address and port (as outlined in Section 4.3) to 
establish a TCP/IP session with the Replay channel. The client should initiate a session by 
sending the Logon message. The client should identify itself by specifying its CompID in the 
Username (553) field. 
The server will validate the CompID, password and IP address of the client. Once the client 
is authenticated, the server will respond with a Logon message. The SessionStatus (1409) 
of this message will be Session Active (0). 
The client must wait for the serverâs Logon before sending additional messages. Messages 
received from the client before the exchange of Logon messages will be ignored. 
If a logon attempt fails because of an invalid CompID, password or IP address, the server 
will break the TCP/IP connection with the client without sending a Logout. If a logon attempt 
fails because of an expired password, a locked CompID or if logins are not currently 
permitted, the server will send a Logout and then break the TCP/IP connection with the 
client. 
Chittagong Stock Exchange - Market Data Feed (FAST - UDP) v1.07
 _v1.0

 Page 25 / 61 
The Replay channel supports only <100> concurrent logins across all clients. In addition, 
each CompID may login to the Replay channel of a particular market data group up to <10> 
times each day. If either of these limits is reached, the server will reject a new logon attempt 
with a Logout and then break the TCP/IP connection with the client. The SessionStatus 
(1409) of such a Logout message will be Logons Not Allowed (7). 
If a Logon is not received within <5>
 <5
 >
 seconds of the establishment of a TCP/IP 
connection or an Application Message Request is not received within <5>
 <5
 seconds of a 
successful logon, the server will send a Logout and then break the TCP/IP connection with 
the client.  
>
 5.1.2.2 Heartbeats 
The server will not send heartbeats on the Replay channel during periods of inactivity. 
5.1.2.3 Requesting Missed Messages 
The client is expected to transmit an Application Message Request within <5>
 <5
 >
 seconds 
of establishing the connection. 
The message should include the identifier of the Real-Time channel to which the 
retransmission request applies along with the list of messages to be resent. The 
ApplBegSeqNum (1182) and ApplEndSeqNum (1183) fields should be used to specify the 
ApplSeqNum (1181) of the first and last message in the range to be resent. 
The Application Message Request can be used in three modes: 
(i) 
To request a single message. The ApplBegSeqNum (1182) and ApplEndSeqNum 
(1183) should both be the message sequence number of the missed message. 
(ii) 
(iii) 
To request a specific range of messages. The ApplBegSeqNum (1182) should be the 
message sequence number of the first message of the range and the 
ApplEndSeqNum (1183) should be that of the last message of the range. 
To request all messages after a particular message. The ApplBegSeqNum (1182) 
should be the message sequence number immediately after that of the last 
processed message and the ApplEndSeqNum (1183) should be zero (0). 
The retransmission request will be serviced from the serverâs cache of the last <10,000> 
messages published on the Real-Time channel. If the retransmission request includes one 
or more messages that are not in the serverâs cache, the entire request will be rejected and 
no messages will be retransmitted. 
5.1.2.4 Response to a Retransmission Request 
The server will respond to the Application Message Request with an Application Message 
Request Ack to indicate whether the retransmission request is successful or not. If the 
request is unsuccessful, the reason will be specified in the field ApplResponseType (1348). 
An Application Message Request will be rejected via a Business Message Reject if a 
conditionally required field is missing or a request limit (for the day or for outstanding 
requests) is breached. 
In the case of a successful retransmission request, the server will retransmit the requested 
messages immediately after the Application Message Request Ack. The message sequence 
number and, where relevant, the instrument sequence number from the Real-Time channel 
will be included in the ApplSeqNum (1181) and RptSeq (83) fields of each retransmitted 
message. Once the last of these messages is sent, the server will indicate that the 
retransmission is complete via an Application Message Report. 
5.1.2.5 Cancelling of a Retransmission Request 
A client may cancel an outstanding retransmission request via an Application Message 
Request. Such a message should include an ApplReqType (1347) of Cancel 
Retransmission (5) and the ApplReqID (1346) of the request to be cancelled. The server will

 Page 26 / 61 
transmit an Application Message Request Ack or a Business Message Reject to confirm or 
reject the cancellation request respectively. 
5.1.2.6 Termination of the Connection 
If the client does not send a Logout and terminate the connection within <5>
 seconds of 
the transmission of the last missed message, the server will send a Logout message and 
then break the TCP/IP connection with the client. 
<5
 >
 The server will terminate the TCP/IP connection (a Logout will not be sent) if the number of 
messages that are buffered for a client exceeds <1,000>.

Failures at The Chittagong Stock Exchange 
Snapshots on the Real-Time Channel 
In the unlikely event of an outage of a system at The Chittagong Stock Exchange, recipients 
may be required to refresh their order book and statistics displays for one or more 
instruments. 
In such a scenario the server will, on the Real-Time channel, broadcast two Market Data 
Snapshot (Full Refresh) messages for each sub book of each affected instrument: one with 
an MDEntryType (269) of Empty Order Book (J) and the other with an MDEntryType (269) 
of No Statistics (z). In such an event, recipients must discard the contents of their order 
book and statistics displays. Each Market Data Snapshot (Full Refresh) message will 
include the current status of on-book trading for the instrument in the field 
MDSecurityTradingStatus (1682). 
The server will then transmit a series of Market Data Incremental Refresh messages to 
disseminate the current order book and statistics for the sub books of each affected 
instrument. 
Resetting Sequence Numbers 
If the market data feed is, due to the unlikely event of an outage, restarted during a trading 
day, the message sequence number and instrument level sequence number of the Real
Time channel will be reset to 1. 
In such a case, messages sent on the Real-Time channel prior to the resetting of sequence 
numbers will not be available for retransmission on the Replay channel. The trades resent 
on the Snapshot channel, if any, will not contain an ApplSeqNum (1181) or RptSeq (83) if 
there were originally disseminated prior to the resetting of sequence numbers.
