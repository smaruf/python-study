# Level 2 - Intermediate

Advance your automation skills with file operations, process management, and real-world automation tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Perform file operations (create, read, write, backup)
- Manage processes and monitor system resources
- Parse and analyze log files
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use regular expressions
- Schedule automated tasks

## Scripts Included

### Bash Scripts
1. **file_backup.sh** - Automated backup system with rotation
2. **process_monitor.sh** - Process management and resource monitoring
3. **log_analyzer.sh** - Log file parsing and analysis

### Python Scripts
1. **file_backup.py** - Object-oriented backup manager with compression
2. **process_monitor.py** - Advanced process and system monitoring
3. **log_analyzer.py** - Log analysis with pattern matching

### PowerShell Scripts
1. **file_backup.ps1** - Windows backup automation
2. **process_monitor.ps1** - Windows process and service monitoring
3. **log_analyzer.ps1** - Log parsing with PowerShell pipelines

### Batch Scripts
1. **file_backup.bat** - Simple Windows backup script
2. **process_monitor.bat** - Basic process checking

## Key Concepts

### File Operations
- Reading and writing files
- Directory traversal
- File compression
- Backup strategies

### Process Management
- Starting and stopping processes
- Monitoring CPU and memory usage
- Managing services
- Process health checks

### Log Analysis
- Pattern matching
- Error extraction
- Log rotation
- Real-time monitoring

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks
- Exit codes
- Error logging
- Graceful degradation

## Real-World Applications

1. **Automated Backups**: Daily backup of critical files
2. **System Monitoring**: Alert when resources are low
3. **Log Analysis**: Extract errors from application logs
4. **File Management**: Cleanup old files automatically
5. **Health Checks**: Monitor application availability

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a backup script that emails you on failure
2. Build a system monitor that alerts when CPU > 80%
3. Write a log analyzer that generates daily reports
4. Implement a file cleanup script for temporary files
