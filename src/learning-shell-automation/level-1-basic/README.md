# Level 1 - Basic

Master the fundamentals of shell scripting with variables, conditionals, loops, and functions.

## Learning Objectives

- Work with variables and data types
- Use conditional statements (if/else)
- Implement loops (for, while)
- Create and use functions
- Understand parameter passing

## Scripts Included

### Bash Scripts
1. **variables_conditionals.sh** - Variables and conditional statements
2. **loops.sh** - Different types of loops
3. **functions.sh** - Function creation and usage

### PowerShell Scripts
1. **variables_conditionals.ps1** - Variables and conditional statements
2. **loops.ps1** - Different types of loops (ForEach, For, While, Do-While)
3. **functions.ps1** - Advanced function creation with parameter validation

### Batch Scripts
1. **variables_conditionals.bat** - Variables and conditional statements
2. **loops.bat** - Loops and iteration
3. **functions.bat** - Subroutines (Batch's version of functions)

### Python Scripts
1. **variables_conditionals.py** - Variables and conditional statements
2. **loops.py** - Various loop types and comprehensions
3. **functions.py** - Functions with different parameter styles

## Key Concepts

### Variables
Learn how to declare and use variables in each scripting language.

### Conditionals
Master if/else statements and comparison operators.

### Loops
Understand different loop types and when to use them.

### Functions
Create reusable code blocks with parameters and return values.

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a script that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to N
2. Write a function that checks if a number is prime
3. Build a simple calculator using functions
4. Create a script that validates user input

## Next Steps

After completing Level 1, move to [Level 2 - Intermediate](../level-2-intermediate/README.md) to learn about:
- File operations
- Error handling
- Process management
- Log analysis
- Regular expressions
