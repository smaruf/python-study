# Level 3 - Advanced

Master DevOps practices with CI/CD pipelines, Docker, and infrastructure automation.

## Learning Objectives

- Build complete CI/CD pipelines
- Manage Docker containers
- Automate deployments
- Integrate with APIs
- Handle database operations
- Implement configuration management

## Scripts Included

### Bash Scripts
1. **ci_cd_pipeline.sh** - Complete CI/CD pipeline implementation
2. **docker_management.sh** - Docker container lifecycle management
3. **api_integration.sh** - REST API integration and automation

### Python Scripts
1. **ci_cd_pipeline.py** - Object-oriented CI/CD orchestrator
2. **docker_manager.py** - Advanced Docker automation
3. **config_manager.py** - Configuration management tool

### PowerShell Scripts
1. **ci_cd_pipeline.ps1** - Windows CI/CD automation
2. **docker_management.ps1** - Docker management with PowerShell

### GitHub Actions
1. **ci-cd-workflow.yml** - Production-ready GitHub Actions workflow

## Key Concepts

### CI/CD Pipelines
- Build automation
- Automated testing
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning
- Automated deployment
- Rollback strategies

### Containerization
- Docker image building
- Container orchestration
- Multi-stage builds
- Registry management
- Health checks

### Infrastructure as Code
- Configuration management
- Environment variables
- Secret management
- Template rendering

### API Integration
- REST API calls
- Authentication
- Error handling
- Rate limiting
- Response parsing

## Real-World Applications

1. **Complete CI/CD**: From code commit to production
2. **Container Management**: Deploy and scale applications
3. **Infrastructure Automation**: Provision and configure servers
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Connect to monitoring platforms
5. **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Staging and production workflows

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a full CI/CD pipeline for a web application
2. Build a Docker-based development environment
3. Implement blue-green deployment strategy
4. Create an automated rollback mechanism
5. Set up automated security scanning

## Best Practices

- **Version Control**: Track all automation scripts
- **Idempotency**: Scripts should be safe to run multiple times
- **Error Handling**: Always handle failures gracefully
- **Logging**: Log all important operations
- **Security**: Never hardcode credentials
- **Testing**: Test pipelines in non-production first

## Next Steps

Advance to [Level 4 - Expert](../level-4-expert/README.md) to learn about:
- Multi-cloud deployments
- Kubernetes orchestration
- Advanced orchestration patterns
- Production-ready systems
- High availability setups
