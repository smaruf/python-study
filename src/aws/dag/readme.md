## DAG Summary

This document provides an overview of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) used in this project for managing workflows in AWS. 

### Overview
A DAG is a collection of tasks organized in a way that defines their execution order based on dependencies. This ensures that tasks are executed in a sequence that respects their dependencies.

### Components
1. **Nodes**: Represent individual tasks in the workflow.
2. **Edges**: Define the dependencies between tasks.
3. **Root Node**: The starting point of the DAG.
4. **Leaf Node**: The final task in the sequence.

### Benefits
- **Parallel Execution**: Tasks without dependencies can run concurrently.
- **Failure Handling**: Easy to identify and handle failures in specific tasks.
- **Scalability**: Suits complex workflows with many interdependent tasks.

### Usage
1. Define tasks in the `tasks.py` file.
2. Set up dependencies in the `dag.py` file.
3. Execute the DAG using the command: `python run_dag.py`.
