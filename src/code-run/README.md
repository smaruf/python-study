## Features

- **Variety of Problems**: Covers a range of problem types, including algorithmic challenges, data structure manipulations, and coding puzzles.
- **Structured Solutions**: Each problem includes a well-documented solution to help you understand the approach and logic.
- **Modular Code**: The code is written modularly, making it easier to read, run, and reuse.

## Problem Descriptions

### From `code_problem.py`
- **Reverse String**: Reverses a given string.
- **Check Palindrome**: Checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- **Find Duplicates**: Finds duplicate elements in a list.
- **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: Generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.
- **Calculate Factorial**: Calculates the factorial of a number.
- **Check Anagram**: Checks if two strings are anagrams.
- **Merge Sorted Arrays**: Merges two sorted arrays into one.
- **Find Missing Number**: Finds the missing number in a list of integers.
- **Maximum Subarray Sum**: Finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray.
- **Count Vowels**: Counts the number of vowels in a string.

- **Check Prime Number**: Checks if a number is prime.
- **Rotate Matrix**: Rotates a matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
- **Longest Common Prefix**: Finds the longest common prefix among a list of strings.
- **Validate Parentheses**: Validates if a string contains valid parentheses.

### From `search.py`
- **Binary Search**: Performs binary search on a sorted array.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Searches for a node in a graph using BFS.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Searches for a node in a graph using DFS.
- **Binary Tree Search**: Searches for a value in a binary search tree.

### From `sorting.py`
- **Bubble Sort**: Sorts a list using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
- **Insertion Sort**: Sorts a list using the Insertion Sort algorithm.
- **Merge Sort**: Sorts a list using the Merge Sort algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: Sorts a list using the Quick Sort algorithm.
- **Binary Sort**: Sorts a list using the Binary Sort algorithm (uses a Binary Search Tree).

### From `water_level_heights_bfs.py`
- **Assign Heights to Land and Water Cells**: Assigns heights to cells in a matrix following specific rules, ensuring the maximum height is maximized while satisfying constraints.
