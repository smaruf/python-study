## Star Wars Game

This is a simple Star Wars game implemented in Python. To play the game, clone the repository and navigate to the `src/games/starwars` directory. Optionally, create and activate a virtual environment, then `install` the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Finally, run the game with `python game.py` and follow the on-screen instructions.
