### OpenAI trials:

The `openai` folder contains scripts and examples for using OpenAI's API and performing various machine learning tasks. Below is an overview of the contents and their purposes:

#### Contents

- `correct_grammer.py`: Script for correcting grammar using OpenAI's API.
- `weighted_learn_01.py`: Implementation of a Perceptron binary classifier using weighted learning.
- `weighted_learn_02.py`: Example of using the Perceptron classifier on the Iris dataset.
- `supervise_learn_01.py`: Example of supervised learning using the Iris dataset.
- `unsupervise_learn_01.py`: Example of unsupervised learning using the Iris dataset.
- `text_to_command.py`: Script for converting text to programmatic commands using OpenAI's API.

#### Usage

##### Correct Grammar

To correct grammar using OpenAI's API, run the `correct_grammer.py` script:

```sh
python correct_grammer.py
```

##### Perceptron Classifier

To use the Perceptron classifier, you can run the `weighted_learn_01.py` and `weighted_learn_02.py` scripts:

```sh
python weighted_learn_01.py
python weighted_learn_02.py
```

##### Supervised Learning

To perform supervised learning using the Iris dataset, run the `supervise_learn_01.py` script:

```sh
python supervise_learn_01.py
```

##### Unsupervised Learning

To perform unsupervised learning using the Iris dataset, run the `unsupervise_learn_01.py` script:

```sh
python unsupervise_learn_01.py
```

##### Text to Command

To convert text to programmatic commands using OpenAI's API, run the `text_to_command.py` script:

```sh
python text_to_command.py
```

#### Summary

The scripts in the `openai` folder provide examples of using OpenAI's API for various tasks such as grammar correction and text-to-command conversion, as well as implementing machine learning algorithms on datasets like the Iris dataset.
